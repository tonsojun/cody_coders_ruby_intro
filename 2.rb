# Data structures

# An array looks like this - ["cat", "dog", "wolf"]

# You can access elements in the array with this syntax


# array = ["cat", "dog", "wolf"]

# puts array[0]
# => "cat"


# puts array[1]
# => 'dog'


# Notice that the first element is 0.

# The last element is usually accessed like this:

# array[array.length - 1]
# => "wolf"

# Write a function, with a test as seen in the last assignment which takes an array as an argument 
# and returns the first element in the array.

# Write a function, with a test as seen in the last assignment which takes an array as an argument 
# and returns the last element in the array.

# Write a function, with a test as seen in the last assignment which takes an array as an argument
