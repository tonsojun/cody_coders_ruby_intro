Intro to HTML forms

Cool so hopefully with the basics out of the way we can return to web development

Forms are the most common way to do HTTP requests from a web page

 <form action="/action_page.php" method="get">
  <label for="fname">First name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="fname" name="fname"><br><br>
  <label for="lname">Last name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="lname" name="lname"><br><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form> 

There are various input types you can do. Learn text inputs and hidden inputs

<input type="hidden" id="custId" name="custId" value="3487"> 

action is the destination URL of the form. Method is the HTTP request type ie GET, POST, etc.


name is used to determine what the variable is named in the requests

Create a .html page like this
<html>
<body>
your stuff goes here
</body>
</html>

Save it as a .html file and open it in a web browser.

https://webhook.site/

This website allows you to create an API endpoint which will receive your HTTP requests and display them.

Create the following forms on the HTML page, put in your webhook.site URL 
and then take a screenshot of the HTTP requests from that page and post it in #standup

a POST form with just a "name" text input
a POST form with just a hidden input named "mysecretvalue" - value of it can be anything

a PUT form with an integer input "lucky_number"

a POST form with "my_birthday" JQueryUI datepicker

Use a JQueryUI date input

You can either pull the JqueryUI code from a CDN or host it locally. Include it in your app with a script tag. Google for more instructions

This is the most popular datepicker because it works perfectly on all web browsers
